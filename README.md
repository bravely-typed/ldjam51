# Ludum Dare 51 Entry: Hotel CAT-astrophe

This game was created over 3 days for Ludum Dare 51, with the theme "Every ten seconds..."

This game was made in Unreal Engine 4. This repository contains the C++ source code, but not any assets or Blueprints.

## Story and gameplay

A cat named Bellhop is the manager for a hotel for other cats. The hotel is very successful, but
it's a lot of work keeping everybody satisfied! Especially when the guests aren't always the most
considerate...

As Bellhop, climb around the hotel's many rooms and platforms, helping guests check in and cleaning
up after unruly customers. The faster you help each patron, the more fish coins they'll tip you!

Remember, your guests are very tired, and won't have the energy to come and get you when they have
a problem. Make sure to check in on everybody to guarantee their stay is as happy as possible!

## Controls

AWSD or arrow keys to move, SpaceBar to jump!
J to check cats in at the front desk!
Run back and forth inside a messy room to clean it!
